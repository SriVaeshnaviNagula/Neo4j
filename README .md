# nthlevelfriend

In this project we are working on knowing the nth level friends or the connections in a network using a breadth first search and the Ne04j.


## Setup
First Install neo4j into your system
https://neo4j.com/
Then create a graph database into it by giving the cyher queries.

Connect the neo4j Driver with the python 

Now open the jupyter notebook and select a created nthlevelnodes file (nthlevelnodes.ipynb) and execute cells 

## Steps to execute

Execute the code in jupyter notebook:
https://jupyter.org/

1st cell asks for the input user van give their own inputs or given below are the sequence of the input to be given:


Sample Input

6

0 6 -1 -1

1 2 -1 -1

1 3 -1 -1

2 4 -1 -1

3 6 -1 -1 

4 5 -1 -1 

-1 -1

1 2

Sample Output

4 6

Next move onto the python code with neo4j 

Connect neo4j is the first cell

Connect to graph database

now run the python scripts with respect to the inputs present here we have automatically given the kth value as 3.

## To execute the Code in google cloud

Please create an instance for Linux

Install the miniconda and python there and the in the nanoeditor create the python code and save

now execute the code with 'python .py file'
